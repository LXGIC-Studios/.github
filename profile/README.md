### What we build

Open source AI dev tools. All free. All run with a single `npx` command. No installs, no config files, no signup walls.

We think developer tools should just work. You shouldn't need to read a 40 page doc to generate a README.

### Quick Start

Pick a tool. Run it. That's it.

```bash
# Generate a README for your project
npx ai-readme-gen

# Write commit messages that actually make sense
npx ai-commit

# Add alt text to every image in your project
npx ai-alt-text

# Never manually create a .env file again
npx ai-env-gen
```

No global installs. No accounts. Just `npx` and go.

### Why we build in the open

Every tool we make is open source. We don't gate features behind paid tiers. If it's useful, it should be free.

We write about what we're building, what we're learning, and where AI dev tools are headed on our [Substack](https://lxgicstudios.substack.com). No fluff, just real stuff from the build.

### Stay in the loop

We ship fast and talk about it publicly. Best way to keep up:

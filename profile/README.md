### What we do

We build CLI tools that handle the tedious parts of development. Commit messages, READMEs, OG images, .env files. The stuff you do every day but shouldn't have to think about.

Everything runs through `npx`. No global installs, no config files, no accounts. Pick a tool and run it.

### The tools

| Tool | What it does | Try it |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **[ai-readme-gen](https://github.com/LXGIC-Studios/ai-readme-gen)** | Reads your code, writes your README | `npx ai-readme-gen` |
| **[ai-commit](https://github.com/LXGIC-Studios/ai-commit)** | Looks at your staged diff, writes the commit message | `npx ai-commit` |
| **[ai-alt-text](https://github.com/LXGIC-Studios/ai-alt-text)** | Generates alt text for images in your project | `npx ai-alt-text` |
| **[ai-env-gen](https://github.com/LXGIC-Studios/ai-env-gen)** | Scans your code and builds the .env file | `npx ai-env-gen` |
| **[ai-og-image](https://github.com/LXGIC-Studios/ai-og-image)** | Creates Open Graph images from a prompt | `npx ai-og-image` |
| **[ai-pdf-builder](https://github.com/LXGIC-Studios/ai-pdf-builder)** | Generates full PDFs with AI | `npx ai-pdf-builder` |

### Try one right now

```bash
# point it at your project and get a README back
npx ai-readme-gen

# stage some files, then let it write the commit
npx ai-commit

# scan your images and get alt text for all of them
npx ai-alt-text

# figure out what env vars you actually need
npx ai-env-gen
```

That's it. No setup. No API keys on the free tiers.

### Why open source

We don't think developer tools should cost money. If something saves you 10 minutes a day, it should just be free. So everything we make is MIT licensed and always will be.

We write about what we're shipping and learning on [Substack](https://lxgicstudios.substack.com). No fluff. Just what's actually happening in the build.
